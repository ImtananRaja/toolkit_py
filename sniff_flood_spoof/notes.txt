# macchanger <options> <interface> # kali linux command

macchanger -r eth0 # randomly assigns a new mac address to the interface

# To manually change your mac address in linux follow these steps
1) ifconfig eht0 down
2) ifconfig eth0 hw ether AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF # here we are saying the eth0 interface hardware ethernet change mac address to AA:BB etc
3) ifconfig eht0 up
# if after running them commands you fail to establish a connection with the internet then run
service NetworkManager restart
# hopefully this should fix ito

you can use the scapy tool in kali to help spoof your mac address
get the mac address adn ip address of the router and then send a arp broadcast message using scapy
and then when you get a response from some machines. send a response back with the routers normal IP
but with your own machines mac address
