# Mac changing, used to get around black/white listing
# macchanger <options> <interface> # kali linux command
macchanger --show eth0 # shows the mac address of the interface
macchanger -r eth0 # randomly assigns a new mac address to the interface

# To manually change your mac address in linux follow these steps
1) ifconfig eht0 down
2) ifconfig eth0 hw ether AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF # here we are saying the eth0 interface hardware ethernet change mac address to AA:BB etc
3) ifconfig eht0 up
# if after running them commands you fail to establish a connection with the internet then run
service NetworkManager restart
# hopefully this should fix it
